# Strategic Alliance Builder

A web platform that connects brands with organizations based on strategic alignment, helping them move from transactional sponsorships to mutually beneficial partnerships.

## Project Overview

The Strategic Alliance Builder addresses the evolving nature of brand partnerships in today's strategic landscape. As organizations shift from traditional sponsorships to more integrated, co-creative partnerships, this platform provides the tools to identify, evaluate, and manage these strategic alliances.

### Core Problems Solved

1. **Finding the Right Partners**: Brands struggle to identify organizations that align with their strategic goals beyond simple demographic overlap.
2. **Measuring Partnership Value**: Traditional metrics like impressions fail to capture the full value of strategic partnerships.
3. **Managing Co-Creation**: Collaborative projects between partners often lack clear frameworks and KPI alignment.
4. **Learning from Success**: Organizations have limited access to case studies and proven partnership frameworks.

## Features

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Bootstrap 5
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Matching Algorithm**: JavaScript-based scoring system with weighted attributes
- **Deployment**: Static site with client-side processing

## Implementation Approach

The application is designed as a client-side web application that does not require server-side processing or databases. All data is stored in the browser's local storage, with options to export and import data as JSON files.

This approach allows for easy deployment, testing, and iteration without complex infrastructure requirements.

## Future Enhancements

- API integrations with CRM systems
- Machine learning-based partnership recommendations
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile application for on-the-go partnership management
