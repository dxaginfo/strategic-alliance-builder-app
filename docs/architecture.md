## Data Model

### Profile Object

```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "type": "brand|organization",
  "name": "Entity Name",
  "industry": "Industry Category",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "values": ["Value 1", "Value 2", "Value 3"],
  "audience": {
    "demographics": {...},
    "psychographics": {...},
    "regions": [...]
  },
  "goals": ["Goal 1", "Goal 2", "Goal 3"],
  "partnershipCriteria": {
    "industryPreferences": [...],
    "valueAlignment": {...},
    "audienceReach": {...}
  }
}
```

### Partnership Object

```json

  "id": "partnership-id",
  "parties": ["profile-id-1", "profile-id-2"],
  "status": "proposed|active|completed",
  "alignmentScore": 85,
  "createdDate": "2025-06-17",
  "objectives": ["Objective 1", "Objective 2"],
  "kpis": [
    {

    }
  ],
  "timeline": {
    "milestones": [...]
  },
  "roi": {
    "calculations": {...},
    "projections": {...}
  }
}
```

## Matching Algorithm

The core of the Strategic Alliance Builder is the partner matching algorithm, which works as follows:

1. **Profile Analysis**: Extract key attributes from each profile
2. **Alignment Scoring**: Calculate alignment scores across multiple dimensions:
   - Value Alignment (30%)
   - Audience Complementarity (25%)
   - Goal Compatibility (25%)
   - Industry Relevance (20%)
3. **Weighted Ranking**: Generate a ranked list of potential partners based on overall alignment score
4. **Filtering**: Apply user-defined filters to narrow down matching results

The algorithm uses a combination of exact matching (for criteria like industry or region) and fuzzy matching (for values and goals) to identify potential partnerships.

## ROI Calculation Methodology

The ROI calculator evaluates partnership value using multiple factors:

1. **Direct Value**:
   - Brand exposure
   - Lead generation
   - Sales conversions
   
2. **Indirect Value**:
   - Brand perception lift
   - Audience engagement
   - Market influence
   
3. **Long-term Value**:
   - Relationship development
   - Market positioning
   - Innovation potential

Each factor is assigned a weight based on the partnership goals, and the overall ROI is calculated using both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.

## User Workflows

### Brand/Organization Profile Creation

1. User registers/logs in
2. User completes profile form with organization details
3. User defines partnership criteria and preferences
4. System saves profile to local storage
5. User can export profile as JSON

### Partner Matching

1. User navigates to matching interface
2. System applies matching algorithm to find potential partners
3. User views ranked list of potential partners
4. User can filter and sort results
5. User can select a partner to view detailed alignment analysis

### Partnership Management

1. User creates a new partnership record
2. User defines objectives, KPIs, and timeline
3. System creates visualization dashboards
4. User updates progress and metrics
5. System calculates current ROI and projections

## Responsive Design

The application is designed to be fully responsive, with three primary layouts:

1. **Desktop** (1200px+): Full-featured interface with side-by-side comparisons
2. **Tablet** (768px-1199px): Optimized layout with collapsible sections
3. **Mobile** (< 768px): Streamlined interface with sequential workflow

## Security Considerations

While the application stores data locally, the following security measures are implemented:

1. Data validation for all user inputs
2. Optional password protection for exported data files
3. Data anonymization options for sensitive information
4. Clear data storage disclosure and user controls

## Future Architecture Extensions

The architecture is designed to be extended in the future with:

1. **Backend Integration**: Optional connection to a server for multi-user functionality
2. **API Ecosystem**: Integration with third-party services like CRM systems
3. **Machine Learning**: Enhanced matching using ML algorithms
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket integration for collaborative editing
